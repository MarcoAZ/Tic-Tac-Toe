#Tic Tac Toe Game
A tic-tac-toe game using 3D arrays and command line arguments. It allows two users to play tic-tac-toe and view the board after each move. A 3 x 3 array represents the board and it must be consulted to confirm legal moves, a full board, and a victory condition. Another aspect of the program is the ability to select the number of games to play with a command line argument. Without a command line argument, only one game is played.
The exercises that I completed before the project simplified the entire process for tic-tac-toe. The function needed to check for a winning condition was practically the same as one I created before for checking the sums of a square array. That function was most likely the only difficult part of the game. The rest was simple to figure out on paper and translate into code. However, I did have some difficulty getting pointers to work again. A function required changing a value in the main function, which required using pointers. Most of my time was spent designing the program and the actual programming went by quickly and smoothly
